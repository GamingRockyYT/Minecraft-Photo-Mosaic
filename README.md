# Minecraft-Photo-Mosaic
Sorry for any trouble I'm just a junior programmer

1. Put the folder "Minecraft Photo Mosaic" into your desktop

2. Download "textures" from this link and put it in "Minecraft Photo Mosaic"

3. Change line 66 into your own directory

4. Save a target.webp / target.png / target.jpg / target.jpeg into the folder "Minecraft Photo Mosaic"

5. Run

6. Choose resolution (6 to 8 recommended, choosing 4 or below will give you a higher resolution but will also extend the runtime and intensify your CPU)

7. Wait

8. output.jpg should appear after the program finishes running

(Check Line 66 of code)
