Sorry for any trouble I'm just a junior programmer

Put the folder "Minecraft Photo Mosaic" into your desktop

Unzip the textures folder

Change line 66 into your own directory

Save a target.webp / target.png / target.jpg / target.jpeg into the folder "Minecraft Photo Mosaic"

Run

Choose resolution (6 to 8 recommended, choosing 4 or below will give you a higher resolution but will also extend the runtime and intensify your CPU)

Wait

output.jpg should appear after the program finishes running

(Check Line 66 of code)
